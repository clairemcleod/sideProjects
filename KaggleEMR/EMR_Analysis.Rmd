Materials
In 2012, Kaggle hosted a EMR-based competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/pf2012). They provided de-identified data for 9k+ patients, and posed the question of 'Who has diabetes?'. The data were provided in 19 tables for the provided training and test sets:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(RSQLite)
n <- dbDriver("SQLite", max.con=25)
con <- dbConnect(n, dbname="data/compData.db")
grep("test", dbListTables(con), value=T)
```
